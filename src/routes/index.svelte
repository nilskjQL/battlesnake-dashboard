	<h1>Queenslab Battlesnake night üêç</h1>

	<p>
		Welcome to the epic game of battlesnake at Queenslab! This is a multiplayer snake arena game where last standing
		wins. Please have a look at the rules of the game <a target='_blank'
																												href='https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/rules'>Battlesnake Rules</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Each team build and deploy a web server that implements the <a href='https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/api'
																																	 target='_blank'>Battlesnake
		API</a>. When a game is created, the game engine will make HTTP requests to your Battlesnake server, sending game
		board information and asking for your next move. Your Battlesnake's behavior is determined by how you program it to
		respond to these requests.
		There will be several battle rounds so you can iterate and perfect your team strategy!
